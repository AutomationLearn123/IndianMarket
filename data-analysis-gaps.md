# Data Analysis Gaps in Current System

## What Kite Provides vs What LLM Needs

### ‚úÖ AVAILABLE FROM KITE:
1. **Real-time Tick Data**: Price, volume, timestamp
2. **OHLCV Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume per minute/day
3. **Order Book Depth**: Top 5 bid/ask levels with quantities
4. **Current Market Data**: LTP, total volume, buy/sell quantities
5. **Historical Data**: Past OHLCV data for pattern analysis

### ‚ùå MISSING FOR ADVANCED ANALYSIS:
1. **Volume Profile**: Volume distribution at each price level
2. **Time & Sales**: Every single trade with size, price, time
3. **Tick-by-Tick Sequences**: Price movement patterns
4. **Imbalance Detection**: Buy vs sell pressure over time
5. **Market Microstructure**: How orders are filled, cancelled
6. **Statistical Patterns**: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
7. **Volume Footprint**: Volume at each price level throughout the day
