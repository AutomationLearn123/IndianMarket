## üéØ Analysis Criteria

### Breakout Detection
- **Opening Range**: 9:15-9:45 AM high/low levels
- **Breakout Confirmation**: Price breaking above/below with volume
- **Time Validation**: Must be within first 30 minutes for best signals

### Volume Analysis  
- **400% Spike**: Current volume vs historical average
- **Time-based Volume**: Volume concentration in breakout period
- **Volume Profile**: Distribution throughout the day

### Order Book Imbalance
- **Current Snapshot**: Buy vs Sell quantity ratio
- **Stacked Detection**: 2-3 consecutive periods of same-direction imbalance
- **Significant Threshold**: >30% imbalance ratio

### LLM Decision Logic
```
IF (Opening Range Breakout + 400% Volume + Buy Imbalance) 
   THEN "BUY" with 80-95% confidence

IF (Opening Range Breakdown + 400% Volume + Sell Imbalance)
   THEN "SELL" with 80-95% confidence

ELSE "NO GOOD" with 50-70% confidence
```
